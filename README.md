This repository contains data published in [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.635881/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Microbiology&id=635881). The data spans the 16S rRNA V3–V4 region (10 samples from 10 individual guts) and ITS2 (10 samples from 10 individual guts) region as specified in the sample metadata.The primers used in this study include:   314F-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and 805R-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC for the V3–V4 region and F5-GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC and R5-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC for the ITS2 region. However, the data shared here has already been trimmed off the primers. During the analysis, the reads were truncated at lengths 290 and 241 for the forward and reverse reads respectively, to filter out low quality bases dominant in the ends.
